##Background
I'm a scientist-practitioner, currently working in a school district with just over 3,000 students. My position is split into two roles. First, I'm the District Response-to-Intervention (RtI) Coordinator, and secondly, I'm the school psychologist for the high school and department head for secondary special services.

In these roles, I provide psychoeducational evaluations, consult with teachers about academic, social, emotional, and behavioral interventions, lead professional development, and conduct site-based research studies to help us better identify and provide intervention services for kids.

##Purpose of This website
I just created this website, so it's still under active development (you'll have to excuse broken links or confusing pages). However, I find myself passing along more and more resources that I (or teams and I) have developed in the last couple years. This website will include blog posts about topics relevant to working with kids, data analysis and psychometrics, and most importantly, serve as a place to hold resources for intervening with kids.
